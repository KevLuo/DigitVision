# DigitVision

This project applies computer vision principles to automatically recognize handwritten digits.  DigitVision has several defining characteristics:

1.  Neural networks built from scratch
2.  PCA from scikit-learn (Principle Component Analysis)
3.  Diagnostic visualizations, including learning curves and validation curves
